### Reflections and Comments

1. This assignment went ok. It wasn't quite as challenging for me as I thought it would be (if I did it right).

2. I tried to make my code DRY so I put a lot of it inside functions but I wasn't sure how I could make the object literals anymore DRY so that they didn't have the same methods in each one.

3. It took maybe about 3 hours...? Maybe a little more. I wasn't sure how long it would take me originally though.
